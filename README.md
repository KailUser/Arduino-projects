# My Arduino Projects

This is a collection of Arduino projects that I have created for fun and for learning purposes. Each project is contained in its own folder and has its own set of files, including the Arduino sketch, any necessary libraries, and a README file explaining what the project does and how to use it.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

[Project 1](https://github.com/KailUser/Arduino-projects/tree/main/Led_And_Photoresistor)

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need an [Arduino board](https://store.arduino.cc/), a USB cable to connect it to your computer, and the [Arduino software](https://wiki-content.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your computer. You can download the Arduino software from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/).

Each project folder contains a README file with instructions on how to set up the hardware and run the program. The README file also includes a list of the required components and any libraries that need to be installed.
